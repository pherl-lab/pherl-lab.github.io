**News: PhD Positions Available in the group!** For more information, go [here.](https://pherl-lab.github.io/pherl-lab/vacancies) Join us! 

We are a Human-Robot Collaborative Control and Robot Learning research group in the [University of Sydney School of AMME ](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-aerospace-mechanical-and-mechatronic-engineering.html) and at the [Australian Centre for Robotics](https://robotics.sydney.edu.au/). 

Our goal is to develop principled, structured methods to enable *seamless, adaptive human-robot interaction and collaboration*. We explore human-robot interaction and collaboration through the lens of robot learning and optimal control. We develop useful algorithmic interfaces for humans to intuitively interact with and control complex, dynamic robotic systems. 

I am currently building up my lab in the University of Sydney, right in the heart of Sydney. We will exchange ideas with [world class roboticists] here at USyd and their research groups. I am also a proud member of the [Australian Center for Robotics](https://superc2033.com/our-team/).

**I am looking for passionate new PhD, Masters, and Undergraduate students to join the team!** [(more info)](https://pherl-lab.github.io/pherl-lab/vacancies) **!**
