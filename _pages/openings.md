# Open positions

**We are currently have openings for undergraduate, Masters, and PhD positions!**

You will have the chance to work on the cutting-edge research on principles of human-robot interaction, controls and learning. You will be involved in developing the theoretical understandings of human-robot interaction and collaboration, designing novel algorithmic and robotic frameworks for enabling seamless, intuitive, and efficient human-robot collaboration and interaction. Our goal is to just develop new frameworks for human-robot learning and control, but to develop structured, physically grounded principles of interaction and collaboration, that enable intelligent autonomous systems that understand, collaborate and adapt in real-world human-robot scenarios. 

### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions
Due to the many emails, I may not reply if you send me one. To get involved, fill in [this form](https://forms.cloud.microsoft/r/SvcRJj6nxT). In the cover letter section, state briefly why you are interested our lab and what types of research problems you are interested in investigating. Please provide a CV, including and for current undergraduate and masters students, include information about the relevant coursework and grades you had. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. 

### Fellowship Opportunities
We especially welcome PhD and Postdocts with fellowships. I'd be happy to support you through a fellowship application, after you apply to the group. Note that for some countries, there are also fellowships available for outgoing fellows.**
